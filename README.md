# lein-utils

A [Leiningen][] plugin for generating utils.clj file
When starting to developed a new project notised that have to cope over some utils functions over and over again.
Option one will be just to create a shared project where to dump all utils 
funstions but this will bring many functions that project don't need and it will be problem to modify it. 
So the idea was to create a plugin that will download utils functions and made the part of the new project
